        <p>This tool can help you analyze an existing workout plan and find out
          what you can improve,
          but it can also help you build a new plan from scratch.</p>
        <p>For now the tool is mainly focused on <b>hypertrophy</b> (a.k.a.
          muscle
          building)</p>
        <p>However, it&apos;s important to remember that it&apos;s can only give
          you a <b>rough
            guidelines</b>.</p>

      question: 'Who can use it?',
      answer: <>
        <p>Hope is the tool can be useful for everybody interested in
          hypertrophy.</p>
        <p>
          If you are only a <b>beginner</b> and got a workout plan from
          somewhere
          (like the Internets),
          the tool can hopefully tell you if it&apos;s a at least a sensible
          plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are an <b>intermediate or advanced</b> lifter, it can help you
          build your own plan or refine an existing one.
          You could also use it to build plans for other people.
        </p>

      slug: 'where-is-the-data-stored',
      question: 'Where is the data stored?',
      answer: <>
        <p>Nothing is stored on the server at the moment.</p>
        <p>
          All the data is stored in your browser&apos;s local storage.
          It means that if you clear your browser&apos;s cache, all your data
          will be
          lost.<br />
          Also, if you use different browsers or computers, you won&apos;t see
          your
          plans.<br />
          You can export and import them via &quot;Copy URL&quot; button though.

      question: 'I can\'t find an exercise I want to add',
      answer: <>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the tool doesn&apos;t have a database of all possible
          exercises.<br />
          But you can use generic variants of exercises to substitute for the
          missing ones.<br />
          Just search for the keyword &quot;any&quot; in the exercise list and
          pick the
          suitable option,
          for example &quot;Any chest variation&quot;.

        <p>
          I wanted something powerful and unstoppable, so an icebreaker was a
          natural choice üòÅ<br />
          But how is that related to fitness? Let&apos;s name
          it &quot;Bicep&quot; - that&apos;s how!<br />
          P.S. Yes, naming is hard. Shut up.
