      answer: <>
        <p>This tool can help you analyze an existing workout plan and find out
          what you can improve,
          but it can also help you build a new plan from scratch.</p>
        <p>For now the tool is mainly focused on <b>hypertrophy</b> (a.k.a.
          muscle
          building)</p>
        <p>However, it&apos;s important to remember that it can only give
          you <b>rough
            guidelines</b>, and your individual preferences, needs and goal
          might differ from what the algorithm is doing.</p>
        <p>
          If the tool gets any traction, I&apos;ll try to add more features
          to provide more flexibility and configurability.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of the day, remember that consistency is way more
          important,
          than any specific workout plan.

      question: 'Who can use it?',
      answer: <>
        <p>Hope is that the tool can be useful for everybody interested in
          hypertrophy and fitness.</p>
        <p>
          If you are a <b>beginner</b> and got a workout plan from
          somewhere
          (like &quot;the Internets&quot;),
          the tool can hopefully tell you if it&apos;s a at least a sensible
          plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are an <b>intermediate or advanced</b> lifter, it can help you
          build your own plan or refine an existing one.<br />
          You could also use it to build plans for other people.
        </p>

      slug: 'cant-find-exercise',
      question: 'I can\'t find an exercise I want to add',
      answer: <>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the tool doesn&apos;t have a database of all possible
          exercises.<br />
          But you can use generic variants of exercises to substitute for the
          missing ones.<br />
          Just search for the keyword &quot;any&quot; in the exercise list and
          pick the
          suitable option,
          for example &quot;Any chest variation&quot;.

    {
      slug: 'how-to-count-drop-sets',
      question: 'How do I count drop sets, rest pause, etc?',
      answer: <>
        <p>
          The tool doesn&apos;t have a special support for drop sets, rest
          pause and other advanced intensity techniques at the moment.<br />
          It&apos;s kinda personal and depends on how much they mess you up,
          but the rule of thumb might be - count them 2 for 1 and error on the
          lower side.<br />
          So 1 or 2 drop sets would be counted as 1 set, 3 or 4 drop sets would
          be
          counted as 2, etc. Same with rest pause sets.<br />
          It&apos;s even more difficult with cluster sets, you have to go by
          feel.

      slug: 'where-is-the-data-stored',
      question: 'Where is the data stored?',
      answer: <>
        <p>Nothing is stored on the server at the moment (but it probably will
          be in the future).</p>
        <p>
          All the data is stored in your browser&apos;s local storage.
          It means that if you clear your browser&apos;s cache, all your data
          will be lost.<br />
          Also, if you use different browsers or computers, you won&apos;t see
          your plans.<br />
          You can export and import them via &quot;Copy URL&quot; button though.

        <p>
          I wanted something powerful and unstoppable, so an icebreaker was a
          natural choice üòÅ<br />
          But how is that related to fitness? Let&apos;s name
          it &quot;Bicep&quot; - that&apos;s how!<br />
          P.S. Naming is hard. Shut up.
