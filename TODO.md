* Use better UI labels for all stuff like "Muscle Groups", "Movement Patterns", etc

* Let ppl ignore a unit for a program or entirely ("account" level)
  * Add other personal settings
* Dark theme
* "Save as" for a shared or draft program with a name prompt
* Add frequency to simple analytics
* Add overall volume to analytics (e.g. too many specializations)
* Drag and drop for exercises and days
* Move analytics calculation to web workers
* Maybe add neck?
* Exercise variations (like Bicep curls - EZ bar, BB, DB, cable, etc)
* Set mods - straight, giant, drop, rest-pause, etc
* Throttle autosave for draft programs
* Use debounce for analytics
